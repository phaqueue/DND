## I started playing DND since June 2023. I'm currently participating in [West Marches 3](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/wm3-esyellow13/) hosted by UCSD RPG club. Here's my [DND Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/members/Balloonicorn) account and [Roll20](https://app.roll20.net/users/12581151/yunfan-q) account.

## I love DND, because it boosts players' creativity. The video games only give players limited choices and force them to choose one between them, while DND allows players to come up with a solution out of infinite possibilities, which may even not be expected by their DM. Maybe AI will be a perfect DM in the future...
