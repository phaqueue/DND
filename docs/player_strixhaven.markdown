## The campaign started in November 2023. The DM was a postdoc at UCSD. This campaign was cursed, because many people joined and quitted due to various reasons, and it was in danger of being canceled because of lack of players.

## Rules: 5e, all extensions except UA, minor homebrew.

## PC:
### &emsp; Name: Anarchist
### &emsp; Class: Fiend Warlock
### &emsp; Race: Tiefling
### &emsp; Alignment: Chaotic Evil (though the DM wanted to trivialize the alignment)
### &emsp; Background: Anarchist was homeless since he started to remember things, and he was treated unequally as a minority. He gradually developed the idea of overthrowing the current government, and he spread this idea to his friends tirelessly, which was why he got his name. A demon appreciated his idea, so he became Anarchist's patron and gave him destructive forces. One day, he was "offered" by a government agent 009 to enroll in the best university in the country, Xinghue University. He was unable to refuse because there was no chance of defeating 009, so he boarded the train to the university...
### &emsp; Character Development: Anarchist tried to attract some followers to overthrow the government with him in the future, but that was not effective. He later bribed the mayor of a town at the border of the country so that he could accept some homeless Tieflings. These Tieflings appeared to be peasants, but they were in fact Anarchist's secret army. Several months later, a war went on, and a battalion from the enemy country was about to seize the town. The mayor escaped, and knowing that there was no hope of winning the battle, Anarchist surrendered and turned the town into a tributary state, Nevertheless, Anarchist became the de facto leader of the town.

## Teammates:
### &emsp; 1. Aster, a wood elf wizard. He's fond of inventing spells, or equivalent spells that's accessible to limited classes.
### &emsp; 2. (I forgot her name), a human bard. Her mom and sister were all sick, so she wanted to get a barchelor's degree and a better job after she graduates.
### &emsp; 3. Warden, a surveillance robot barbarian (Note, its player has quitted the campaign). It works for agent 009. When it rages, it will switch to another personality.

## Plotline:
### There seemed to be some conspiracy in the school. Anarchist and his teammates encountered several weird monsters such as a backpack that had eldritch goos in them. They reported these cases to 009 after defeating them. They also embarked on several fun adventures. For example, they enjoyed egg hunt and exploring a professor's house. They also had several exams, though Anarchist always tried to cheat and never studied.
