## I'm working in the 血族Bloodline team as an intern. To be honest, I don't like this game. It's a backward gacha game that has lived for almost 10 years. The game itself is boring, but nonetheless, it tries really hard to encourage its players to pay real world money. However, even though I hold negative opinions on this game, my supervisor and my colleagues are nice, and I have learned a lot from them.

## What I have learned:
###     1. How to write Game Design Documents (with Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, and Excel).
###     2. How to use video editing softwares (Capcut) and photo editing softwares (GIMP).
