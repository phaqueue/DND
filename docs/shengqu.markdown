## I'm working in the 血族Bloodline team as an intern. To be honest, I don't like this game. It's a backward gacha game that has lived for almost 10 years. The game itself is boring, but nonetheless, it tries really hard to encourage its players to pay real world money. However, even though I hold negative opinions on this game, my supervisor and my colleagues are nice, and I have learned a lot from them. The only bad news is that they are often too busy doing their own work, so they may not even have time to assign me any task.

## What I have learned:
###     1. How to write Game Design Documents (with Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, and Excel). I have written 2(don't forget to update the number!) so far. And of course I have studied the previous GDDs.
###     2. How to use video editing softwares (Capcut) and photo editing softwares (GIMP). These are great tools to express your ideas to programmers and artists.
