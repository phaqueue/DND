## I had DMed this campaign when I was doing an internship at Shengqu Games from April 2024 to July 2024. This was my first non-oneshot campaign, so I did face some challenges.

Nine years later, after the old priest died, she decided to seek vengeance. The Cult of Bhaar offered her help, and trained her to assassinate her "foes". Several years later, when she realized that she was in fact used by the cult, she left without the approval of the head of the cult, and she was hunted by the cultists since then.

## Plotline:
### Session 1: The adventurers arrived at the village and they all joined the mission to rescue the missing siblings. The owner of the inn hosted a bonfire party for them at night, where the adventurers also met a poor peasant who wanted to join them and earn fast money to save his ill mother. The adventurers embarked on the mission the next day and they were ambushed by four twig blights. Our adventurers finished them with ease, though the peasant was freaked out and climbed onto a branch of a tall tree. While the others were searching for loot, our paladin went to the tree and helped the peasant climb down. The peasant thanked her and claimed to give her a ring as a gift, but he pulled out a dagger instead from his pouch, and stabbed the paladin. The peasant then revealed himself: he was actually an assassin who was sent to hunt down the paladin. The paladin was instantly knocked out, and the remaining adventurers had to defend themselves. The assassin wanted to use the nearby bush and trees to hide himself, but the druid and the artificer set them on fire. In the end, the assassin was killed, and the adventurers found 2 daggers with patterns associated with Bhaar, and a magical ring as well.
