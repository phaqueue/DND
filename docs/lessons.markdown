## These are the lessons I learned when playing DND. I will add more in the future.

## As a player:
### &emsp; 0. Respect your DM. Even if you believe they are doing wrong, they have the final say. Try to argue with them politely, and if they insist, just follow their rule. You can treat it as a houserule anyway. You may consider quitting if you have to, but do it peacefully.
### &emsp; 1. Don't build a high level rogue. Rogues at higher levels are weaker than other class, because their sneak attack works only once per turn (referring to [this campaign](https://phaqueue.github.io/dnd/player/dragons_of_stormwrack_isle)). You should consider multiclassing. For example, some people multiclass in Hexblade Warlocks to gain proficiencies in medium armor and shield, and the ability to curse as well.
### &emsp; 2. Do not prioritize healing as a cleric (referring to [this campaign](https://phaqueue.github.io/dnd/player/wm3)). Only heal your teammates when they are down. Think of action economy. For example, your healing word can heal around 6 HP, and an enemy deals 20 damage on average per turn. If you cast healing word to your teammate, you only reduce one enemy's damage from 20 HP to 14 HP with the cost of a spell slot, a bonus action, and also the chance to cast another spell. You would even achieve nothing if your teammate's HP is around say 5 HP. If you manage to control several enemies with upcasted command, you prevented, or healed, 20 HP times the number of enemies you controlled. However, you should definitely heal your teammates if they are down. If they start their turn with 0 HP, their turn will be skipped, which will be a huge loss in terms of action economy. Gaining a whole turn in exchange for a healing word is definitely worth it, or multiple turns in exchange for a mass healing word or aid (by the way, you should always precast aid).
### &emsp; 3. Value dexterity, unless you are wearing heavy armor. A higher AC is always good. It's also useful against spells like fireball.
### &emsp; 4. You can flavor your equipment, your skills, or anything for fun. 5e is oversimplified, so you have to spend more effort customizing your character.

## As a DM:
### &emsp; 0. Respect your players. You are serving your players, bringing joy to them. We play DND for fun, so if a player does not seem happy, you might be doing something wrong.
### &emsp; 1. Add content warning. Your players may have traumas you don't know, and you don't want to hurt them.
### &emsp; 2. Always communicate with your players, especially when there are signs of discord among you.
### &emsp; 3. Always be prepared to improvise. Your players may either do stupid things or come up with a super genious solution that you would never expect.
### &emsp; 4. If you believe the game is not balanced for some players(for example, someone rolled low stats for their PC, or someone is not familiar with the rules), bring restrictions to the overpowered PCs (for example, no stat can exceed 18 at level 4) and magic items to the weak PCs.
### &emsp; 5. Always have background music, and remember to change it when the session reaches a different stage.
### &emsp; 6. Design fun combats. Some people may believe that long combats ruin their game experiences, so prove them wrong. With the help of some interesting mechanics, impose a disadvantage to your players, giving them a sense of hopelessness but also some hope of winning. When they gradually gain control of the combat and finally win, they will be overwhelmed by happiness and a sense of achievement.
### &emsp; 7. Never double-tap a PC if its player is absent. The player will highly likely be unhappy to see their PC's death when they have done nothing wrong.
### &emsp; 8. When introducing an important NPC, show the picture of them to the players also.
