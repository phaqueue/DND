***Golden Idol.*** If the madman possesses the golden idol, he can use it to cast the "Decrease" and "Increase" spells. The DC is 16. He can use an action to cast a "Decrease" spell, and a bonus action to cast the "Increase" spell of the same type. In addition, while attuned to it, the golden idol cannot be stolen.
### Actions
***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6+2) slashing damage. 
:
***Decrease Heat.*** If no creature is within 5 feet of him, the madman reduces the heat of a 15-foot-radius sphere. Each creature must&nbsp;make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes 4d6 (14) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The affected area also becomes difficult terrain. If there's at least one creature within 5 feet of him, he must cast this spell on one of the targets instead. The target must&nbsp;make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 8d6 (28) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
:
***Increase Heat.*** It can be cast using a bonus action if the madman has cast Decrease Heat in the same turn. It is almost identical to Decrease Heat, except that it deals fire damage, and the ground is on fire if it is cast on an area.
:
***Decrease Air.*** This can only be cast if no creature is within 10 feet of him. He decreases the air of a 30-foot-radius sphere with him being the center point. Each creature must&nbsp;make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw. It can be chosen by the creature. A target takes 2d8 (9) force damage, becomes 10 feet closer to the madman, and falls prone on a failed save.
:
***Increase Air.*** It can be cast using a bonus action if the madman has cast Decrease Air in the same turn. It is almost identical to Decrease Air, except that there's no prerequisite to cast this spell, the creatures move towards the opposite direction if they fail the saving throws, and they take 2d4(5) extra bludgeoning damage if they hit a wall or another creature.
:
***Decrease Youth (1/Day).*** The madman drains the life of a creature within 5 feet. This creature must&nbsp;make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a fail, this creature becomes 20 years older, takes 3 levels of exhaustion, and becomes paralyzed for one turn. On a success, this creature becomes 10 years older and takes 2 levels of exhaustion. The madman should cast this spell when his HP is below half.
:
***Increase Youth (1/Day).*** It can be cast using a bonus action if the madman has cast Decrease Youth in the same turn. The madman restores youth that was absorbed from his victim. If the creature failed the saving throw required by Decrease Youth, the madman becomes 20 years younger, gains 50 temp HP,&nbsp; and gains the effect of Haste for 1 minute without the need for concentration. If the creature succeeded, the madman becomes 10 years younger and gains 30 temp HP.
### Reactions
***Shield.*** The madman can cast Shield up to his Proficiency Bonus times.
:
***Cancel Condition.*** When the madman is under abnormal conditions, the golden idol can use its reaction to cancel his condition.
