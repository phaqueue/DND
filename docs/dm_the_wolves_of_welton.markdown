## I DMed this one-shot for my cousins around Chinese New Year 2024. They are not familiar with DND, I'm a new DM, and we only have 2 players, so it was quite a challenge for me.

### &emsp; Background: He was raised by his grandfather in an isolated island. As superb fishermen, they had managed to catch lots of rare and large fish, which would be sold to merchants who would sail to the island occationally. One day, 唐吉诃德 was tired of living in the island, so he decided to leave his grandfather and visit the town nearby, where 狼8 lives.
### &emsp; Character Development: None. It's a one-shot.

## Plotline:
### One day, 狼8 saw the quest of evicting wolves in a nearby village. He wanted to accept the quest, but the receptionist, Mr. Smith, was absent. He was told that Mr. Smith was probably drinking in the bar. He had a hard time finding Mr. Smith as well as waking him up. By the time Mr. Smith woke up, 唐吉诃德 found 狼8 and asked him to repair and enhance his fishing tools. Mr. Smith then asked 唐吉诃德 to join the mission with 狼8. He agreed, so they headed to the village in the afternoon. They found several wolves attacking a shepherd midway. They helped him drive the wolves away, and the shepherd led them to the village. The adventurers learned that the wolves in the forest suddenly became intelligent recently, around the time when the Father's brother disappeared. They had then become a major threat to the village, so the council organized an attack on the wolves' nest, but everyone except a halfling was never heard of since then, who was found unconscious in front of the tavern, probably as a sign of warning. The Halfling also lost his mind after he woke up, so no one knew the truth. The adventurers spent time gathering intel for the rest of the day, and they traveled to the forest early in the morning the next day. They accidentally found and woke up an owlbear in the forest. The owlbear was hurt badly by the wolves and was persuaded by 唐吉诃德 to join them. Tbc...
