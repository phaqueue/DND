## PC:
### &emsp; Name: Medic
### &emsp; Class: Order Cleric (previously Life Cleric)
### &emsp; Race: Stout Halfling
### &emsp; Alignment: Lawful Good
### &emsp; Background: Medic loved to practice the art of healing, and he did various experiments in his little hut for years. Recently he decided to do some field study and also help those in need, so he started his adventure...
### &emsp; Character Development: He believed that healing was always the priority until he was killed and revived. He met his god (TF2 Medic) and realized that if the enemies were all dead before they could do any damage, there would be no need for healing; preventing damage was healing. Thus, he changed his focus and prioritized dealing damage and controlling enemies.
