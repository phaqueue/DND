## I participated in this campaign around the time Bulder's Gate 3 was fully released. At that time, I wasn't quite familiar with the basic rules.

<br>
<br>

## Rules: 5e, no extensions.

<br>

## PC:
### &emsp; Name: Dismas
### &emsp; Class: Assassin Rogue
### &emsp; Race: Elf
### &emsp; Alignment: True Neutral
### &emsp; Background: He and Reynauld encountered some monsters on their way home after defeating the Ancestor (referring to "Darkest Dungeon"). They decided to hide because they were too exhausted, but failed because Dismas tripped on something. Reynauld covered him and died, and Dismas soon followed him due to overwhelming remorse. He died with the thought that he should have better stealth. He reincarnated in a new world by chance and prioritized stealth unconsciously (referring to "Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious").
### &emsp; Character Development: None. Sadly I was new to DND at that time and never thought about this.

<br>

## Teammates:
### Dismas had 3 teammates, but sadly I only remembered them being a fighter, a sorcerer, and a warlock. I don't remember any more details.

## Plotline:
### Dismas and his teammates were travelling on an airship, and the ship malfunctioned midway. What's worse, a mindflayer had sneaked into the passengers and transformed some of them. After all the mindflayers were dealt with, the team reached the ground (with feather fall) and started to explore the isle. From the native Kobolds, Myconids, and a mysterious woman who appeared in their dreams (she was the guardian of the isle, a gold dragon), Dismas and his friends learned that a group of cultists was developing dark magic, and they would soon destroy all of the magic stones which were protecting the isle. The team defeated a dragon and its master, a large chimera, and a lich, and finally destroyed their nest. The harmony was restored, and the adventurers were rescued by their friends in the government. A happy ending.
