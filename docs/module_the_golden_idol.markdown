title: The Golden Idol

---

## This is my first module(one-shot). I wrote it on Chinese New Year's Eve (after finishing the game "The Case of Golden Idol"), which took me around 6 hours. Since my lack of experience, I believe the monsters may either be overpowered or underpowered. I will revise them in the future.

<br>
<br>

## Rules: 5e, all extensions except UA

## PC Level: 5

## Background:
### &emsp; Rumor says that there's a mindflayer doing evil experiments on a golden idol, which possesses unnatural powers, in a cave nearby. Many have tried their luck, but they never came back. This rumor also aroused the interest of our adventurers. The story begins as they set foot in the dungeon...

<br>

## Map:

<br>

## Entrance:
### &emsp; Describe the cave to your players as cold and damp, which also smells moldy. The light condition is dim light. After everyone walks into the cave, ask them to make a DC 12 Dexterity save. On a failed save, the character falls prone due to the slippery moss on the ground. If the players attempt to explore the room, tell them that they don't see anything noticeable, but two narrow paths with unknown destinations. It would take the players around 10 minutes to reach the next room.

<br>

## Room 1:
### &emsp; There is no sign of lives in this room. Instead, hundreds of mice's dead body and two goblins' dead body are laying on the ground. A success on a DC 10 investigation check can tell that there was a fight happening between goblins and hordes of rats recently, as their bodies are still fresh. If the player rolled 15 or higher, also tell them that the goblins won the fight.

<br>

## Room 2:
### &emsp; This room is 20 feet lower than Room 1. When the players reach this room, they will see 1 hobgoblin and 4 goblins resting near a bonfire. The hobgoblin looks stronger than an average hobgoblin, and he's wearing a fancy mantle (Mantle of Spell Resistance) A success on a DC 15 insight check can tell that they are not looking happy. If the adventurers approach them, they will stand up and warn them not to come any closer. The players can choose either befriend the goblins or fight them. The DC is only 10 if they ask the goblins to fight with them, since they have realized that they are too weak to explore the cave alone after losing 2 fellows. On a success, the goblins will follow the players until the hobgoblin is dead or 3 goblins are dead. The players can do a DC 20 persuation or intimidation check to call them back. If the players choose to fight them, they will gain hobgoblin's Mantle of Spell Resistance. Their stats are the same as hobgoblin and goblins, except that their HP is doubled. Besides the goblins, also let the players know that there's a small pond in the corner of the room, and the water is flowing. A creature of medium size or smaller can dive into the pond. If the players can breathe underwater, they can find a path and reach the lake room. Otherwise tell your players that they don't have enough oxygen to follow the path. Even if the goblins are granted the ability to breathe underwater, they are reluctant to swim, unless the players rolled a 15 or higher on a persuation check.

<br>

## Room 3:
### &emsp; When the players enter this room, they will see spider webs everywhere. There are also several giant spider cocoons, inside which are probably the dead bodies of other adventurers. What's worse, there are two giant spiders along with 5 spiders in the middle of the room and they will initiate the combat once they see the players. The monsters' stats are the same, except that each living giant spider will reproduce 1 spider each round as lair action. After the combat ends, a success on a DC 15 investigation check allows the player to find a corpse with 50 GP and 2 healing potions inside a spider cocoon. If it's burnt, the corpse drops, and the healing potions will be broken.

<br>

## Room 4:
### &emsp; I'll add more details in the future. Short version: The players don't get to fight. They can hear noises coming from the East of the room. A roll of 12 or higher on a perception check can tell the players that the noises are actually a man's laughter, and a roll of 16 or higher also allows the player to hear the words "golden idol".

<br>

## Room 5:
### &emsp; I'll add more details in the future. Short version: The players will encounter 8 skeletons, 4 frontliners with shortswords, and 4 with shortbows. A success on a DC 13 investigation check can tell that these skeletons were newly raised, who were probably once adventurers seeking the golden idol.

<br>

## Room 6:
### &emsp; I'll add more details in the future. Short version: The players see a bonfire, a tent, and a chest, and it seems very comfortable (referring to "Dragon Age: Origins"). The players must succeed a DC 13 Wisdom save, or they will be drawn to the bonfire. They then need to succeed a DC 15 Wisdom save, or they will fall asleep unless they are elves. Players can investigate the room if they are not affected by the magic. If they roll below 10, they don't find anything wrong; if they roll between 10 and 14, they find no traces of people living here; if they roll between 15 and 19, they also sense the presence of magic; if they roll above 19, they will realize that the chest is in fact a mimic. The mimic will attack the adventurers if all of them are asleep, it's under attack, or an adventurer tries to open it.

<br>

## Room 7:
### &emsp; I'll add more details in the future. Short version: the players will see an earth elemental showing their back to them, and a shiny shovel next to it. If the players choose to steal the shovel, their roll on stealth check must be equivalent or higher than the earth elemental's passive perception, or the earth elemental will initiate the combat. If the players initiate the combat, they gain one surprise round. Once the earth elemental is defeated, it will sink into the ground and drops an "Earth Elemental Trophy", which grants the wearer resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks while attuned to it.

<br>

## Room 8:
### &emsp; I'll add more details in the future. Short version: It's underwater, and light condition is darkness. There are 2 merrows blocking the players' way. If any of the players is wearing magical item, they will start the combat. If no one can see through darkness, the players will be surprise attacked. If the merrows don't see any magical items, they will only warn the adventurers to leave.

<br>

## Lake:
### &emsp; I'll add more details in the future. Short version: Players see a clean lake, about 25 feet wide 50 feet long. Similar to the pond in Room 2, the players can try to dive into the water, and reach Room 1 and Room 8 if they can breathe underwater. Note that the goblins are unwilling to swim as stated in the description of Room 2. In addition, a success on a DC 12 perception check can tell that there are sounds of snoring coming from a platform that's 30 feet higher than the ground. The wall is wet and hard to climb, but if the players make loud enough noises, the owner of the snoring, a friendly merchant, will wake up and throw down a rope.

<br>

## Merchant Room:
### &emsp; A mid-aged drawf is sleeping. When players approach him, he will be alerted and wake up if he hasn't. If players ask why he's here, he'd explain that he entered the cave 15 days ago to search for some materials, but he was trapped here. He was resting in a shrine in the East, but 5 days ago a group of adventurers claimed it and threw him out. One day later the way to the shrine even collapsed, so he did not know what happened to the adventurers. He's now still selling his stuff except his rations. He's selling healing potions, equipment, and various level 1-3 scrolls, including a Water Breathing scroll. If the players ask the merchant to give them that scroll for free, they need to pass a DC 15 persuasion or DC 20 intimidation check. If failed, the merchant will ask them to retrieve the magical shovels robbed by an earth elemental and clean the rubbles for him in exchange for the scroll (magical shovel: you can use an action to send a 1*1*1 feet rock, or part of the rock, to another plane). The merchant will not follow the adventurers unless a player rolls a Nat 20. If the players try to attack him or steal his goods, he will use an action to wear his armor, grab his weapon, and fight the players. He's a level 8 Samurai fighter, with 76 HP and 19 AC. He is using a great sword and has Great Weapon Master Attack and Heavy Armor Master. His stats modifiers are +4, +3, +3, -1, +0, -1, respectively. If any of the adventurers is down, he will ask the adventurers to leave and stop the fight. Besides the merchant, the players can also see a lake in the West, though it is 30 feet below.

<br>

## Rubbles:
### &emsp; These rubbles can only be cleared with the magical shovels, or with the help of the goblins on a successful DC 18 persuasion check. If the rubbles are cleared without the magical shovels, everyone gains 2 levels of exhaustion. Once the rubbles are cleared, the players can see a shrine shining with golden light.

<br>

## Shrine:
### &emsp; The players see a large fountain in the middle of the room, and a large statue as well. A success on a DC 13 religion check tells the players that it is the statue of Iomedae, the goddess of righteous valor, justice, and honor. The players can take a long rest here once, without the risk of being surprise attacked. The players can choose to pray to Iomedae and gain the effect of Bless until they take a long rest. On a successful DC 13 investigation check, players can find a hidden small statue of a demon with a goat head. After a subsequent successful DC 13 religion check, they'll recognize it as Baphomet, a demon lord in the Abyss. They can choose to pray to Baphomet instead and sacrifice 10 Max HP in exchange for 2 temporary maw demon allies. The environment will also change if they finish praying: the fountain will flow blood instead of water, Iomedae's idol will crack, and the shrine will be shining with scarlet light. The players can only pray to one of the idols, and they do not know the consequences of praying, though they can feel that their energy is drained when praying to Baphomet, and the praying can be stopped. 

<br>

## Boss Room:
### &emsp; There's only one madman doing experiment on the golden idol. If the players come in from the shrine, they need to pass a DC 15 perception check to notice the trap. If they fail to find out or fail to disable it (DC 13), they will take 2d8 damage and suffer the effect of slow for one round. This will be noticed by the madman, and he will say "Haha, new test subjects!" and initiate the fight. If they come out from water, they can choose to surprise attack the madman. If they choose not to fight him immediately, they can do investigation checks. If one rolls lower than 10, they see corpses of several adventurers and a mindflayer; if the roll is from 10 to 13, they realize there was a fight between a group of adventurers and a mindflayer, and the madman was the sole survivor; if the roll is from 14 to 18, they also see the traces of ice and fire on the ground; if the roll is above 18, they also find a body of an extremely old adventurer. Let your players guess why such an old man was fighting the mindflayer. If they continue to explore the room after defeating the madman, they will find a working desk, some manuscripts, some fresh and rotten apples, and some young and old rats. Tell your players that this room was once the study of the mindflayer until the adventurers came. The madman then studied the manuscripts and became mad when he learned the power of the golden idol. Before the players leave the cave through the secret door, they must satisfy the goblins' demands if they are still with the players. It is for you to improvise. After that, the campaign ends.
