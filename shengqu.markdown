## I'm working in the 血族Bloodline team as an intern. To be honest, I don't like this game. It's a backward gacha game that has lived for almost 10 years. The game itself is boring, but nonetheless, it tries really hard to encourage players to pay real world money.

## 1. [DND Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/)
### &emsp; It's a website that allows you to create and manage your characters. It's free, but to unlock the extensions, you need to buy their digital books or have someone share their books with you.

<br>

## 2. [Roll20](https://roll20.net/)
### &emsp; It's a free virtual tabletop. A new DM may start their first one-shot [here](https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/module/40/the-masters-vault).

## 3. [avrae](https://avrae.io/)
### &emsp; It's a useful Discord Bot for playing DND online.

<br>

## 4. [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/)
### &emsp; It's an advanced virtual tabletop. You need to pay 50 bucks and it's hard to learn, but people say it's worth it. I haven't tried it yet, but I will in the future.

## 5. [纯美苹果园](http://bbs.goddessfantasy.net/bbs/)
### &emsp; It's a great resource for Chinese DND players, especially because they(we) cannot access google or DND Beyond due to you-know-why. People can download the Chinese translation of DND rulebooks for free, discuss DND, look for games, and so on.
